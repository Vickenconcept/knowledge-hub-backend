We are developing a powerful, intuitive web-based application that enables users to fully manage their X (formerly Twitter) presence directly from a centralized platform.

Once authenticated, users can manage posting, replies, threads, and interactions directly within the app.

Data privacy and secure API token management will be prioritized.

2. Mentions & Engagement Dashboard
Real-time feed of recent mentions and replies from other users.

In-app notifications for new interactions (e.g., mentions, likes, replies).

Quick-reply interface for responding directly to mentions or DMs from the dashboard.

3. Content Creation & Publishing

Single tweets

Structured threads (using in_reply_to_tweet_id to chain tweets)

Support for immediate posting or scheduling tweets and threads for future delivery.

Post preview and formatting tools.

4. Post & Thread Scheduling
A calendar or timeline interface to manage scheduled posts and threads.

Users can edit or delete scheduled items before they are published.
