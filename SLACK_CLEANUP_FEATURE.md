# 🧹 Slack Channel Cleanup Feature

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Implemented

---

## 🎯 **Feature Overview**

When you **disconnect a Slack connector**, the bot will now:

1. ✅ **Leave all joined channels** automatically
2. ✅ **Clean up its presence** from your workspace
3. ✅ **Delete all associated data** (documents, chunks, vectors)

This provides a **clean disconnection** experience and respects Slack workspace hygiene.

---

## 🔄 **How It Works**

### **During Sync (Joining Channels):**

```php
// IngestConnectorJob.php
foreach ($channels as $channel) {
    if (!$isPrivate && !in_array($channelId, $joinedChannels)) {
        $slack->joinChannel($accessToken, $channelId);
        
        // Track which channels we joined
        $joinedChannels[] = $channelId;
    }
}

// Save to connector metadata
$connector->metadata['joined_channels'] = array_unique($joinedChannels);
$connector->save();
```

**Result:** Connector knows which channels it joined.

---

### **During Disconnect:**

```php
// ConnectorController.php - disconnect()
if ($connector->type === 'slack') {
    $joinedChannels = $connector->metadata['joined_channels'] ?? [];
    
    if (!empty($joinedChannels)) {
        $slack = new SlackService();
        $results = $slack->leaveChannels($accessToken, $joinedChannels);
        
        // Logs: "Left 10 channels, succeeded: 10, failed: 0"
    }
}

// Then delete all data
$connector->delete();
```

**Result:** Bot leaves all channels before being deleted.

---

## 📋 **Slack API Calls**

### **Join Channel:**
```
POST https://slack.com/api/conversations.join
{
  "channel": "C02Q08SD1T9"
}
```

### **Leave Channel:**
```
POST https://slack.com/api/conversations.leave
{
  "channel": "C02Q08SD1T9"
}
```

**Rate Limiting:**
- 1 second delay between each leave
- Graceful handling of errors
- Continues even if some channels fail

---

## 🎯 **User Experience**

### **Before (Without Cleanup):**
```
1. Connect Slack → Bot joins 10 channels ✅
2. Sync documents → Data indexed ✅
3. Disconnect Slack → Bot stays in channels ❌
4. Result: Bot clutters workspace forever ❌
```

### **After (With Cleanup):**
```
1. Connect Slack → Bot joins 10 channels ✅
2. Sync documents → Data indexed ✅
3. Disconnect Slack → Bot leaves all 10 channels ✅
4. Result: Clean workspace, no leftovers ✅
```

## 🔍 **What Happens During Disconnect**

**Step-by-step process:**

```
1. User clicks "Disconnect" on Slack connector
   ↓
2. Backend checks: Is this Slack? → Yes
   ↓
3. Get list of joined channels from metadata
   Example: ["C02Q08SD1T9", "C02Q1LKCDPZ", "C02QC08RDNH", ...]
   ↓
4. Call Slack API: conversations.leave for each channel
   - Leave channel 1 → Success ✅
   - Wait 1 second (rate limit)
   - Leave channel 2 → Success ✅
   - Wait 1 second
   - Leave channel 3 → Success ✅
   - ... continues for all channels
   ↓
5. Log results: "Left 10/10 channels successfully"
   ↓
6. Delete vectors (set embedding = NULL)
   ↓
7. Delete chunks from database
   ↓
8. Delete documents
   ↓
9. Delete ingest jobs
   ↓
10. Delete connector
   ↓
11. Return success message to frontend
```

**Total time:** ~10-15 seconds (for 10 channels)

---

## 🛡️ **Error Handling**

### **If Slack API fails:**
```php
// Example: Token expired or rate limited
catch (\Exception $e) {
    Log::warning('Could not leave Slack channels', [
        'error' => $e->getMessage()
    ]);
    // Continue with deletion anyway
}
```

**Result:** Connector still gets deleted, data cleaned up.

### **If some channels fail:**
```php
// leaveChannels() returns:
[
    'total' => 10,
    'succeeded' => 8,
    'failed' => 2,
    'errors' => [
        ['channel_id' => 'C123', 'error' => 'not_in_channel'],
        ['channel_id' => 'C456', 'error' => 'channel_not_found'],
    ]
]
```

**Result:** Best effort - leaves what it can, logs failures.

## 📊 **Comparison with Other Connectors**

| Connector | Cleanup on Disconnect |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Google Drive** | Revoke OAuth token ✅ |
| **Dropbox** | Revoke OAuth token ✅ |
| **Slack** | Leave channels + Revoke token ✅ (NEW!) |

## 🧪 **Testing**

### **To test this feature:**

1. **Connect Slack** and sync
   - Check logs: Bot joins channels
   - Check metadata: `joined_channels` array is populated

2. **Disconnect Slack**
   - Check logs: Bot leaves each channel
   - Check Slack workspace: Bot is gone from channels

3. **Verify cleanup:**
   - Database: Connector deleted
   - Slack: Bot not in any channels
   - Clean state!

---

## 💡 **Additional Benefits**

1. ✅ **Workspace cleanliness** - No abandoned bots
2. ✅ **User privacy** - Bot doesn't linger with access
3. ✅ **Professional UX** - Proper cleanup expected by users
4. ✅ **Slack guidelines** - Follows Slack app best practices
